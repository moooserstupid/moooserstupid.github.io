            LightPlay is a game I made in less than a week for the 2023 Winter Gamejam hosted by Mindstorm Studios.
            It involves redirecting a source of light using various light manipulation mechanics and your ingenuity to spread light and capture as many gems as possible.
            It has a minimalist and low-poly aesthetic with a soothing soft pastel colour palette. The game was developed in C# using Unity. The assets are all public-domain.

            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>"Slingshot" mechanic: the paddle can moved updown as well as leftright. The more the paddle is moved down the greater the velocity of the ball when it is hit. This adds a deeper level of skill to the game mechanics.</li>
            <li>Simple tile map creation. You can use notepad to define a block structure and the game will use that to create the map.</li>
            <li>Dynamic collision detection.</li>
            <li>Game speeds up as more tiles are broken.</li>
            <li>Scores recorded and displayed in a retro score table.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Progress </h4> 
            <div id="progress-bar" class="all-rounded">
              <div id="progress-bar-percentage" class="all-rounded" style="width: 90%"><span>90%</span></div>
          </div>
            <h4>Issues / areas to improve</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Collision detection gets a bit wonky at higher speeds.</li>
            <li>The way the blocks change color is inconsistent but this may be a result of the collision detection.</li>
            <li>The increase in speed over the course of the level needs to be fine-tuned. The game is too difficult in its current state.</li>
            <li>Some more sfx and some juicy effects for breaking blocks could be added to improve the feel of the game.</li>
            <li>Hitting the ball with the paddle seems unfairly difficult. Adding some extra invisible grace length to the sides of the paddle would improve player experience and fun.</li>
